# VR-Laser-Cutter-Traning
Abstract 
This project requires the use of Unity and VR equipment to create a virtual environment for laser cutter training. Tutorials on Unity VR are taken to familiarize with the application of the software. Training for manufacturing tools used to be tedious and time-consuming, since one-to-one training is usually required for students to be familiar with the operation, which takes technicians so much time and effort to repeatedly teach individual students. Hence, training using virtual reality might be a way to increase the efficiency of training since students can be trained without technicians and it does not require multiple physical devices for training. Currently, laser cutter, water-jet cutter, 3D printer, and welding machine in virtual space are built to make a virtual ISD Works! for students to interact with machine training.
